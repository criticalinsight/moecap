        "content": "TLT short interest shows a textbook mismatch between what traders are betting on and what the actual market is doing. \nShort interest in TLT (a 20+ year Treasury bond ETF) has hit an all-time high while the ETF price itself has been declining from recent peaks. \nBasically, a massive number of traders have borrowed TLT shares and sold them short, betting the price will keep falling. \nTLT prices move inverse to interest rates, when rates fall, bonds rally hard. \nRight now, the labor market is weakening faster than expected, and the market is pricing in a significant probability of a Fed rate cut at the December meeting. \nIf rates do come down, TLT doesn't just go up a little, it can spike significantly, especially on a 20-year duration bond.\n All those shorts who are underwater would be forced to cover by buying back their shares, which creates a feedback loop that pushes prices even higher. \nThe really interesting part is how much of this short position is actually driven by options dealers hedging call options rather than pure directional bets.\n$TLT short interest jumps to an all-time high \n📈\n📈\n Here we go! https://t.co/QXqs0VNfUQ \n- \nBarchart",

        "content": "Wild, if true.\nThis is WILD.\nTesla just showed Optimus running. Not the stiff, pre-programmed movements we've seen before, actual running with coordinated legs and real stride patterns. \nRunning is fundamentally harder than walking because the robot loses ground contact and has to solve balance in mid air while controlling energy output. If they're comfortable showing this publicly, their motor control and AI training have leveled up significantly.\nThis matters because a humanoid that can run and navigate dynamic environments isn't confined to factory floors anymore. \nYou're talking about real deployment potential in warehouses, construction sites and service work, places designed for human bodies. That's when the unit economics and scaling potential actually become viable.\nTesla's the only player positioned to win here. They own the vertical stack, proprietary AI, sensor data from millions of vehicles feeding back into training, their own chips, and manufacturing that actually scales. \nBoston Dynamics and Figure AI might have better algorithms on paper but they don't have a flywheel or the ability to produce thousands of units cost effectively. Tesla's already built the supply chain for complexity and mass production.\nMost of the market still sees Optimus as 2030 science fair material but if they're casually demoing running robots now and can solve the cost problem, that's a multi hundred billion dollar business hiding in plain sight.\nThe real bet is whether Tesla can actually execute on production and cost which given their track record with EVs is more plausible than people think. \n- \nMilk Road AI",

In the two weeks since the Gemini launch, ChatGPT’s unique daily active users on a 7‑day average are down about 6%, a real hit for a product at this scale. \nThat pullback explains why management is willing to freeze things like ads and side experiments and force the company back into pure product defense mode.​\nFor the AI trade, this is bullish competition and brutal margin pressure at the same time. \nLabs are now forced to spend more on compute, data and talent just to avoid losing share, which is great for the full AI stack from GPUs to power infrastructure, but less great for model only economics. \nThe bigger picture, the disruptor that once triggered Google’s code red is now issuing its own over a Google product, which shows how quickly leadership can flip in this cycle and how valuable the real picks and shovels will be as the model layer starts to look more and more like a commodity.\nOPENAI'S \"CODE RED\" ANNOUNCEMENT:\nThe irony of this announcement is that Google was the FIRST tech giant to issue a \"code red.\"\nOn December 21st, 2022, exactly 3 WEEKS after ChatGPT was announced, Google issued their \"code red.\"\nGoogle was concerned about ChatGPT's threat to \"the future of Google's search engine.\"\nToday, OpenAI has issued their first \"code red\" as Google's Gemini 3 model has seen massive growth.\nOpenAI is now pausing many of their \"side projects\" to focus on improving ChatGPT amid increased competition.\nWhat does this all mean?\nIn our view, this is extremely bullish and yet another sign of the technological revolution we are in now.\nThe immense competition we are seeing in AI is the perfect example of why capitalism is the backbone of innovation.\nMore competition = more innovation = more value creation.\nAsset owners will win. \n- \nThe Kobeissi Letter",

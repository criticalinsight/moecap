        "content": "TLT short interest shows a textbook mismatch between what traders are betting on and what the actual market is doing. \nShort interest in TLT (a 20+ year Treasury bond ETF) has hit an all-time high while the ETF price itself has been declining from recent peaks. \nBasically, a massive number of traders have borrowed TLT shares and sold them short, betting the price will keep falling. \nTLT prices move inverse to interest rates, when rates fall, bonds rally hard. \nRight now, the labor market is weakening faster than expected, and the market is pricing in a significant probability of a Fed rate cut at the December meeting. \nIf rates do come down, TLT doesn't just go up a little, it can spike significantly, especially on a 20-year duration bond.\n All those shorts who are underwater would be forced to cover by buying back their shares, which creates a feedback loop that pushes prices even higher. \nThe really interesting part is how much of this short position is actually driven by options dealers hedging call options rather than pure directional bets.\n$TLT short interest jumps to an all-time high \n📈\n📈\n Here we go! https://t.co/QXqs0VNfUQ \n- \nBarchart",
